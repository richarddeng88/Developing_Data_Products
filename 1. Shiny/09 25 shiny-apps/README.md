# Shiny apps

This directory contains a couple Shiny apps that I created to help with the STAT545 course admin.

- [`request-basic-info`](./request-basic-info) - a Google-Forms-style app that lets class members submit some basic information that will help us with course admin.  [Live demo on my shiny server](http://daattali.com/shiny/request-basic-info/)   
- [`marking-sheet`](./marking-sheet) - a marking sheet that we use for students to peer-review other students' assignments  [Live demo on my shiny server](http://daattali.com/shiny/peer-review/)     

I also created a nice Shiny app for a homework assignment, to visualize cancer data. [Code is here](../hw/hw11_shiny-app#readme), [demo is here](https://daattali.shinyapps.io/cancer-data/)
